# Airport Runway Management System ✈️

A Java Swing application that simulates airport traffic control. It manages flight scheduling, runway allocation, and gate assignment using a GUI.

## Features
- **Visual Map**: Visualizes flight paths and airport nodes.
- **Shortest Path**: Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to route planes from runway to terminal.
- **Live Analytics**: Tracks total flights, emergencies, and holds.
- **Weather Simulation**: Changes in weather affect flight diversion logic.

## How to Run
1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac src/runway/Main.java
